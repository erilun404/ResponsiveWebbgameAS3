          While you are there you start to talk with some different people. You
          meet: Elise 18 years: She is the child of Artur Evans and Ann
          Bernadsson. Elise health has been deteriorating since the last 10
          years. Arthur Evans: the archaeologist who found the box, when he
          digger out the box in a grave 10 years ago. He is not keen on lending

          child feeling so bad. Theodor Brant: An major of the military. His the
          one taking care of the exclusive exhibition.

        <p>
          After a while you and your fellow friends hear Arthur screaming at the
          major: I WANT IT back, it is my property. This outburst will trigger
          Elises health and will make her faint. The ambulance will arrive
          shortly and she will be taken to the hospital.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="worried hidden">
        <p>
          You are worried about Elise, and especially Kalle who took a liking to
          her during the short time they spoke to each other. You also learn
          that Elise's mother is worried, as she is not allowed to talk to her.
          You decide to help Ann get Elise out. You have done this before! Anna
          becomes very happy and tells you that Elise is at Långbro hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          You go and visit her in the hospital. When you arrive at the hospital,
          you ask to see Elise. While you are waiting for the nurse to let you
          in, you hear strange screams from inside one of the halls. And you
          smell a strange smell of seaweed and musty water. After a while you
          will be told that you are not welcome to visit. You think they are
          giving a poor excuse for not letting you in.

          Through a colleague of Anna's, you learn that Elise has changed her
          doctor to Dr. Mild, his name eludes him, he is not of the kind nature.
          He has unorthodox methods to help people, but since Elise has given
          her consent that he will cure her. We can't do anything, right?

          Mälarhöjden. You decide to go there by tram, outside you decide to
          take different roles to try to get into the house. Anna and Johanna

            - Some gynecologist is looking for Elise, they apparently had an
            appointment.

      <div class="goBasement">
        <p class="basement hidden">
          You go down to the basement. When you go down, it's dark and you smell
          seaweed and water. You recognize the smell, it's the same you smelled
          in the hospital and from the rooms where people were screaming! You
          slowly go down the stairs… You see something big longing away in the
          room, it looks like a big tank with water in it, you also see some
          jars on a shelf
        </p>
        <p class="fail-tank hidden">
          You get closer and hear splashing, and there is some movement there.
          It's a strange creature that looks like half human, half fish! You've
          never seen anything so strange before and you feel a cold core running
          down your spine. You become petrified and can't move, you lie down in
          the fetal position and cant move.
        </p>
        <p class="fail-jars hidden">
          You walk up to the cans and take a closer look! You see it's human
          parts in some kind of liquid. A cold chill runs down your spine and
          you become as if petrified and cannot move. You lie down in the fetal
          position and cant get out.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="upstairs">
        <p class="go-upstairs hidden">
          You go upstairs, creep along the corridor. You will see several doors
          leading to different rooms. You discover that in two of them someone
          are snoring. Which room do you want to go in, the left one or the
          right one?
        </p>
        <p class="fail-upstairs-left hidden">
          You go into the wrong room and are discovered by the person who is
          sleeping there. In a panic, you and your fellow friends run outside
          and jump into the taxi that is waiting for you outside. Now how will
          things go for Elise!
        </p>
        <p class="elise hidden">
          You see Elise lying there sleeping. You try to wake her up, but she
          seems difficult to wake up.
        </p>
        <div class="succsess-upstairs-right hidden">
          <p>
            Finally she wakes up, she is disoriented and doesn't really know
            where she is. You all help to get her out without anyone waking up.
            A taxi is waiting for you outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elise mutters about someone who needs rescuing from the basement.
            But you want out as soon as possible. You get out and Elise is
            saved!
