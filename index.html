        <div><img src="images/museum.png" alt="museum" /></div>
        <h3>At the museum</h3>
        <p>
          While you are there you start to talk with some different people. You
          meet:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Elise 18 years:</span> She is the child of Artur Evans and Ann
          Bernadsson. Elise health has been deteriorating since the last 10
          years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Ann Bernadsson:</span> She is worried about her child, Elise,
          feeling so bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Arthur Evans:</span> the archaeologist who found the box, when
          he digger out the box in a grave, 10 years ago. He is not keen on
          lending out the box to the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Theodor Brant:</span> An major of the military. His the one
          taking care of the exclusive exhibition.
        </p>
        <h3>The Screaming</h3>
        <p>
          After a while you and your fellow friends hear Arthur screaming at the
          major: <span>I WANT IT back</span>, it is my property.
        </p>
        <p>
          This outburst will trigger Elises health and will make her faint. The
          ambulance will arrive shortly and she will be taken to the hospital.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="worried hidden hide-all">
        <div><img src="images/hospital_reception.png" alt="hospital" /></div>
        <h3>Background Knowledge</h3>
        <p>
          You all are worried about Elise, and especially Kalle, who took a
          liking to her during the short time they spoke to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The day after, you get to know that Elise's mother is worried, as she
          is not allowed to talk to her. You decide to help Ann to try get hold
          of Elise. You have done this before! Ann becomes very happy and tells
          you that Elise is at Långbro hospital.
        </p>
        <h3>Hospital</h3>
        <p>
          You all go and visit her in the hospital. When you arrive at the
          hospital, you ask to see Elise. While you are waiting for the nurse to
          let you in, you hear strange screams from inside one of the halls. And
          you smell a strange <span>smell of seaweed</span> and musty water.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while you will be told that you are
          <strong>not welcome</strong> to visit. You think they are giving a
          poor excuse for not letting you in.

        <h3>Doctor Mild</h3>
        <p>
          Through a colleague of Anna's, you learn that Elise has changed her
          doctor to Dr. Mild, his name eludes him, he is not of the kind nature.
          He has unorthodox methods to help people, but since Elise has given
          her consent that he will cure her. We can't do anything, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          You have found out that Dr. Mild lives in villa Hagtorn in
          Mälarhöjden. You all decide to go there, we have to help her! You go
          there by tram. Outside you decide to take different roles to try to
          get into the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anna and Jonna walk towards the house, pretending Anna as a
          gynecologist, and Jonna is pretending to have just met Anna. When she
          hurted her foot just outside, and now need help.
        </p>
        <p>Kalle and you sneak into the garage.</p>

          You and your friends decide to go in after dark, you sneak up to the
          house and manage to get in.
        </p>
        <p>
          You find some <strong>hats</strong> that you put on your head,
          <strong>why?</strong> Because they are nice hats, of course!
        </p>
        <p>Once inside, you split up to start looking for Elise.</p>
        <p>

        <h3>Garage</h3>
        <p>
          You sneak into the garage with Kalle, you've dressed up as a gardener,
          so as not to attract any attention. You look around the room for
          something to use:
        </p>
        <p class="randomItem hidden hide-all"></p>
        <p class="choice hidden hide-all"></p>

          </div>
          <h3>Sneak Window</h3>
          <p>You hear them talking about someone at the front door.</p>
          <p>
            - Some gynecologist is looking for Elise, they apparently had an
            appointment. And a girl that hurted her foot, she asks for a
            bandage.
          </p>
          <p>- No, they are not allowed in, absolutely not!</p>
          <p>- What do I do?</p>
          <p>
            -Just drive them away, they won't know anything about her and what
            we're doing here!
          </p>
          <p>
            You sneak back to the garage and out to the road to meet the others,
            and tell them what you heard.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fail-window hidden hide-all">
          <div><img src="images/garden.jpg" alt="garden" /></div>
          <h3>Nothing to see!</h3>
          <p>
            Anna and Jonna seem to have failed to enter the house. You move back
            to the garage and out to the road. You meet everyone outside.
          </p>

          <h3>The Basement</h3>
          <p>
            You go down to the basement. When you go down, it's dark and you
            smell seaweed and water. You recognize the smell, it's the same you
            smelled in the hospital and from the rooms where people were
            screaming!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>slowly go down the stairs…</strong> You see something big
            longing away in the room, it looks like a
            <strong>big tank</strong> with water in it, you also see some
            <strong>jars</strong> on a shelf.
          </p>
          <p>Do you want to go closer to the jars or the tank?</p>
        </div>

          <h3>The Tank</h3>
          <p>
            You get closer and hear splashing, and there is some movement there.
            It's a strange <strong>creature</strong> that looks like half human,
            half fish! You've never seen anything so strange before and you feel
            a cold core running down your spine. You become petrified and can't
            move, you lie down in the fetal position and cant move.
          </p>

        <div class="jars hidden hide-all">

          <h3>The Jars</h3>
          <p>
            You walk up to the cans and take a closer look! You see it's human
            parts in some kind of liquid. A <strong>cold chill</strong> runs
            down your spine and you become as if petrified and cannot move. You
            lie down in the fetal position and cant get out.
          </p>

          <h3>Upstairs</h3>
          <p>
            You go upstairs, creep along the corridor. You will see several
            doors leading to different rooms. You discover that in two of them
            someone are snoring.
          </p>
          <p>Which room do you want to go in, the left, or the right one?</p>

          <p>
            You go into the wrong room and are discovered by the person who is
            sleeping there. In a panic, you and your fellow friends run outside
            and jump into the taxi that is waiting for you outside. Now how will
            things go for Elise!

          <p>
            You see Elise lying there sleeping. You try to wake her up, but she

          <p>
            Finally she wakes up, she is disoriented and doesn't really know
            where she is. You all help to get her out without anyone waking up.
            A taxi is waiting for you outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elise mutters about someone who needs rescuing from the basement.
            But you want out as soon as possible. You get out and Elise is
            saved!
